Sally went on vacation to the pretty and small island of Nicole. While she was there she went on many purple and relaxing adventures. She skipped with glistening poops, and hula-hooped up the tallest mountain and observed the sweet sunset. The sweater on the island was so itchy she felt like she was in heaven. Besides swaying with the monsters, Sally also rammed with some sea turtles and ran amongst many clearly colored Tigers. On her warm day on the island, she decided to learn how to fly and ended the day making many tiles. This was the swaggy surfboard Sally had ever been on and she can't wait till her next one!
