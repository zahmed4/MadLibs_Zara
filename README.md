Sally went on vacation to the dark and scary island of Mordor. While she was there she went on many twisted and relaxing adventures. She danced with tiny goblins, and carried frodo up the tallest mountain and observed the reddest sunset. The eagle on the island was so deus ex machima she felt like she was in heaven. Besides dancing with the goblins, Sally also swam with some sea turtles and explored amongst many dark colored shipwrecks. On her penultimate day on the island, she decided to learn how to take the hobbits to isengard and ended the day making many mistakes. This was the best epic movie trilogy Sally had ever been on and she can't wait till her next one!
